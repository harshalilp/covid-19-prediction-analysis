**Coronavirus Prediction Analysis 📊
Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the spread of COVID-19 using data science and machine learning techniques. It leverages publicly available datasets to forecast case trends, assess mortality and recovery rates, and visualize the impact of the pandemic globally.

**Objectives:**
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Predict future case trends using machine learning models.
Evaluate model performance using error metrics.
Gain insights into country-wise pandemic trends.

**Dataset**
Source: Publicly available COVID-19 datasets- Kaggle

**Features:** Date, Confirmed Cases, Deaths, Recoveries, Country/Region

**Tech Stack & Tools:**
Programming Language: Python 🐍

**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

**Machine Learning Models:**
Linear Regression for trend forecasting
Polynomial Regression for non-linear patterns
Support Vector Regression (SVR) for refined predictions

**Key Insights:**
✔️ COVID-19 cases followed an exponential growth trend.
✔️ Recovery and mortality rates varied across regions.
✔️ Some countries (e.g., US, India, Brazil) had significantly high case growth.

**Future Enhancements 🚀**
Implement LSTMs or Prophet models for better forecasting.
Integrate vaccination and policy data for enhanced predictions.
Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time visualization.
